                <br><br>
                Hi! I'm a senior studying Computer Science (BS) at the University of California, Davis. I'm passionate about 
                all things software and am always on the lookout to grow and push the boundaries of what I know! I also <i>really</i>
                like making sure every detail is right. I'm the person staying up until 2am fixing the space margins on my site.
            </p>

        <h1>My Design Goals</h1>
        <section class="goals">
            <div class="column">01<br><span style="font-size: 2.6rem;">Scalability</span>
                <br><br>One great product can start from one small idea, but every product should have the potential to grow
                in order to be successful. I always aim to build an end-product that not only meets the design goals but also 
                serves to handle an increase in capacity.
            </div>
            <div class="column">02<br><span style="font-size: 2.6rem;">Reliability</span>
                <br><br>A product becomes successful through user trust. I ensure that products are capable of growing with
                user demand while providing a consistent, dependable experience even in the face of technical challenges.
            </div>
            <div class="column">03<br><span style="font-size: 2.6rem;">Practical & Innovative</span>
                <br><br>To deliver practical solutions for real-world applications, I believe you must deal with 
                real-world constraints like production costs and customer needs. It's about finding the right balance between creativity 
                and practicality to develop solutions that are not only cutting-edge but also sustainable and impactful.
